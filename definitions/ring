Definition (ring):
A ring is a abelian group R with an operation * and an element 1 such that
(1) 1 is a multiplicative identity : 1*a = a*1 = a, ∀ a ∈ R.
(2) * is associative : ∀ a,b,c ∈ R, (a*b)*c = a*(b*c).
(3) * is both left and right distributive: ∀ a,b,c ∈ R
		a*(b + c) = a*b + a*c
		(b+c)*a = b*a + c*a
